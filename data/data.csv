"2767","69","c",2768,"PRNLT","1.As soon as you submit a notebook to Alex he will review it and then send feedback as soon as he can. While you are waiting, you should assist any of your teammates who have not submitted their deliverable. Your team will not be able to move on to the next task until each of your team members' notebooks have been witnessed.



2.Once Alex receives your notebook you should receive an email with feedback shortly thereafter. I recommend completing any notebook revisions or helping your teammates finish their deliverables while you wait for his feedback. As soon as all of your team's deliverables have been submitted and witnessed, you can get started on the next task.



3.After you've submitted a notebook and are waiting for feedback from Alex, you should help any of your teammates who haven't submitted their deliverable yet. You could also wrap up notebook revisions you didn't have time to finish earlier. If you still have time before your team meeting, you may want to start working on the final presentation that you will be giving at the end of the internship. You can find an outline of what Alex expects from your presentations in the resource section of Workpro. I recommend that you start working on the background research section of the presentation now.



4.Alex received your notebook and plans on sending some feedback soon. While you wait, revise unfinished notebooks or check to see if your teammates need help completing this deliverable. Once Alex has witnessed the deliverables of everyone on your team, you can all move on to the next task together.



5.Once you've submitted a notebook please assist your teammates who haven't completed the deliverable yet while you wait for the next task. You should also try to complete any outstanding notebooks that still need revisions. Any extra time you have should be spent working on your final presentation. The outline you're expected to follow for your presentations  is located in the resources section of workpro. Now would be a good time to research on the current state of dialysis technology.



6.After you submit a notebook Alex will send you an email with some feedback. While you wait for that email, remember to check and see if your teammates need any assistance. You should also make sure that you've revised incomplete notebooks from previous tasks. Alex won't let your team move forward until he has received a notebook from each of your teammates.



7.Alex wanted me to inform you of a few things you can do after you submit a notebook. You can help your teammates complete their deliverables, revise incomplete notebooks, or work on your presentation. Your presentation should include everything on the presentation outline, which is located in the resources section of Workpro. You may want to consider doing some research on design challenges about developing a dialyzer.



8.Once you've submitted a notebook for the current task, you can expect a response from Alex regarding the quality of your notebook. Until that email arrives, assist your teammates in completing their deliverables or check to make sure you have revised any notebooks Alex has sent back to you. Once everyone on your team has submitted their notebooks, Alex will send you the next task.

9.If you complete your notebook early, there are a few things you should consider doing. You should ask your teammates if they need any help completing their deliverables and complete any of your own notebooks that still need revisions. You should also think about working on your final presentation. In the resources section of Workpro, you can use the presentation outline document to get started on your preparation.



10.If you've completed your notebook and are waiting for the next task you should help your teammates who have not submitted their deliverable yet and work on revising any incomplete notebooks you may have. Also, If you have time before you meet with your new project team, you can work on your final presentation. Use the presentation outline from the resources section of Workpro to guide your preparation.



11.If you've completed your notebook and are waiting for Alex's next task, check to see if your teammates need any help and make sure you're up to date on revisions. Once everyone is finished with this notebook, Alex will send your team its next task



12.Alex stopped by and told me about a few things you can do if you've already submitted a notebook for the current task. You should start by checking to see if your teammates need any help finishing their deliverables or finishing any of your incomplete deliverables. If there's still time before your next meeting, you may want to start working on the references for your final project. It will be useful to reference the presentation outline which can be found in the resources section.



13.After you've submitted a notebook for this deliverable, a feedback email will arrive shortly thereafter. While you wait, ask your teammates if they need any assistance with their deliverables and check to make sure that you are caught up on your deliverable revisions. Alex will only give his next task after everyone has submitted their notebooks.



14.For those of you who are finishing up your notebooks early, Alex gave me a few things you should get started on. While you wait for your next task, you should help your teammates who have not submitted their deliverable yet. Also, make sure that you are up to speed on your own tasks. |4s|If you have time before you meet with your project team, you can also work on your final presentation. I recommend collecting your teams specifications, descriptions, justifications for design choices, and potential limitations for your final prototype. You should also describe which consultants requests your design met and those it did not. |3s|The presentation outline document is a useful tool you can use to see what topics you still need to complete with your teammates before you present.



15.After submitting a notebook, Alex will send you some feedback as quickly as he can. While you wait, it would be great if you could make sure you have revised incomplete notebooks. Once everyone on your team has completed this task, he will send you the final task of your internship.",2,"Player","Introduction and Workflow Tutorial with Entrance Interview",0,1,0,0,0,0,1,1032

Process:  Vapor Deposition Polymerization

Justification:



This design aims to maximize both flux and blood cell reactivity.  The manufacturing process of vapor deposition polymerization maximizes flux in comparison to the other manufacturing options of phase inversion and dry-jet wet printing.  In addition, the biological surfactant has the best blood cell reactivity out of all of the surfactant choices.

Based off of Alan DuChamp's recommendation for reliability, I recommend trying at 1.0%CNT to reach his desired standard of the device operating at 75% of its orginal value at the end of a 9 hour treatment. Amongst the surfactants, hydrophillic is the closest to reaching the DuChamp's desired range of 5 hours and 9 hours since the effect of hydrophilicity increases the time to 75% performance from 1 hour to 5 hours.""",3,"Player","Team designs batch using 1 material",0,0,0,1,1,0,6,120
